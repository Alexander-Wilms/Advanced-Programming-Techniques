1.1
a) -
b) -
c)  sizeof(m_name): 32
    sizeof(m_latitude): 8
    sizeof(m_longitude): 8
f) Best file: CWaypoint.h, since it's included by CWaypoint.cpp and main.cpp
h) Finding: pass by reference results in the variables having the same addresses

1.2
a)  CWaypoint*: Pointer to dynamically allocated memory containing CWaypoints
    CPOI**: Pointer to dynamically allocated memory containing pointers to CPOIs stored in a CPoiDatabase
b) We have a separate CPoiDatabase instance, probably to save memory. CRoute just stores a pointer to the instance. CNavigationSystem creates a CPoiDatabse instance and calls connectPoiDatabase with a pointer to the array.
c)  They shouldn't be accessible when the CNavigationSystem is not running

1.3
f)  Order of implementation: first implement classes, which don't depend on other classes, and then go up the inheritance hierarchy:

CWaypoint
CGPSSensor
CPOI
CPoiDatabase
CRoute
CNavigationSystem
